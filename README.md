# Puppeteer

Puppeteer is an addon for Blender.
It is designed to create animation automations, which are a recorded set of keyframes.
These automations can be pasted from the addon with 2 methods :
- simple pasting (via the Paste operator)
- using the Puppet operator, automations are binded to key stroke, the user can dynamically paste them by pushing these keys
